I know a lot of people don't know me, but I hope they kind of understand the topic, and the significance of it to wrestling around the late part of the early nineties. Back then, kids were a huge target to get to watch the show, and though I didn't start watching until I was a teenager in 1999, I went back to older shows a lot, and saw all the episodes of WWF Monday Night Raw from 1993 last year on burned DVDs from January to about April.<p>Anyway, I put off watching Summerslam of that year with volume until this week, a whole year later after I watched it the first time. What I couldn't realize was why they had the song "I'll Be Your Hero" played, with highlights of the Lex Express tour or "Call to Action" campaign, whatever it was called. It easily was the saddest video and song I had ever seen and heard played on WWF programming, with clips behind it. I didn't mean sad in the way that the song was bad, but that it actually made me feel sad that Lex didn't get the title. I wasn't dissapointed, angry, upset or those kinds of feelings, just sad for some reason unrelated to how he wrestled. It's not even that he was extremely charismatic during that year. So, can anybody give some guesses as to why the creative team, or whoever chose that song might have played it at the end, after Luger celebrated? Wouldn't a more patriotic song have been better, or at least more appropriate?</p><p>P.S.: I am not a Lex Luger fan, nor am I implying that he should have been anywhere near the title, ever. I could have cared less about Yokozuna or Luger, but just felt that this song hurt any replay value of this PPV that it ever showed, not that it gave much in the first place.</p><p>Edit: Since I titled this thread, " 'Who' chose 'I'll Be Your Hero' to close WWF Summerslam 1993", I guess I would like to know educated guesses as to who really gave the idea. A side question would be, was this song popular at the time? I never really was into that kind of music, but the song sounded nice the first time I heard it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmien6fCrr%2BNsKmeq6Shsru7zZ5lnKedZMGpvsSam6xnp528bq%2FHqKqeZZmhuW6uxGawqK2iYrWmvs5mq6hlk6G8tLGMsK6fZaOquq6x0ayjmqVdZoZ6f41raG5rYWt8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chrisley-family-gets-new-tv-show-amid-todd-julies-prison-sentences.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chrisley Family Gets New TV Show Amid Todd, Julies Prison Sentences</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-plays-allison-day-in-dhar-mann-meet-actress-and-tiktok-star-kali-jane-on-instagram-228526-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Plays Allison Day In Dhar Mann?
