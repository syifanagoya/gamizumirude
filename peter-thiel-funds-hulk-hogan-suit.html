Suing gossip blog Gawker for violating your privacy?&nbsp;Use PayPal co-founder, <a href=# title="Peter Thiel Net Worth">Peter Thiel</a>.</p><p>Thiel, who is also one of the earliest investors in Facebook,&nbsp;has admitted to paying about $10 million to fund&nbsp;the lawsuit Terry Bollea (a.k.a. <a href=# title="Hulk Hogan Net Worth">Hulk Hogan</a>) brought against New York-based Gawker Media, as well as other legal actions against the outlet. Hogan sued the site for $100 million after it posted a video in 2012 of him having sex with his former best friend's wife.&nbsp;A Florida jury <a href=#>awarded the wrestler $140 million</a> in March and Florida Circuit Judge Pamela Campbell <a href=#>upheld the award</a> on Wednesday.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-197296 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GettyImages-514540128.jpg alt="John Pendygraft-Pool/Getty Images" width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-197296 class=wp-caption-text>John Pendygraft-Pool/Getty Images</p><p>When the news of the Silicon Valley billionaire's bankroll came to light, Gawker wasted no time attacking Thiel. On Wednesday, the media outlet said in a statement to Huffington Post:</p><p>"According to these reports, a board member of Facebook and the Committee to Protect Journalists has been secretly funding a legal campaign against our journalists."</p><p>But the&nbsp;<a href=#>New York Times</a> reported Thiel doesn't believe his actions are contradictory:</p><p>"I refuse to believe that journalism means massive privacy violations," he said. "I think much more highly of journalists than that. It's precisely because I respect journalists that I do not believe they are endangered by fighting back against Gawker."</p><p>In 2007, Gawker published an article: "Peter Thiel is totally gay, people." Thiel said that article and a series of others about his friends "ruined people's lives for no reason." In a 2009 interview, Thiel described Gawker's writers as terrorists – quite the admonition from a man who also <a href=#>supports Donald Trump</a>. One of his friends convinced him to use his power and money to help other victims of Gawker's coverage defend themselves against the site's attacks.</p><p>"It's less about revenge and more about specific deterrence," he said on Wednesday. "I saw Gawker pioneer a unique and incredible damaging way of getting attention by bullying people even when there was no connection with the public interest."</p><p>But Owen Thomas, the author of the salacious 2007 Gawker story defended his work. (He is now the business editor at the&nbsp;San Francisco Chronicle.) He said he was merely reporting common knowledge about a public figure, and did not "out" the tech billionaire.</p><p>"I did discuss his sexuality, but it was known to a wide circle who felt that it was not fit for discussion beyond that circle," Thomas said in a phone interview with the&nbsp;Times. "I thought that attitude was retrograde and homophobic, and that informed my reporting. I believe that he was out and not in the closet."</p><p>The Silicon Valley's admitted involvement raises questions about whether Hogan had a financial interest in bringing the case to court. At the hearing before Judge Campbell on Wednesday, Seth Berlin, an attorney for Gawker, attempted to introduce printouts of the&nbsp;New York Times and other articles linking Thiel to the case. But the judge stopped him.</p><p>"I don't like looking at all the stuff that's published out there," she said. "It's not healthy."</p><p>Now that Hogan's case is moving into the appellate stage, it remains to be seen whether the Silicon Valley billionaire's bankroll will help or hurt the case. Robert Richards, a professor of First Amendment Studies at Penn State University, told the&nbsp;Wall Street Journal that while Thiel's financing is not illegal, it could set a precedent for other wealthy figures who might want to change the media landscape.</p><p>"If you have a situation now where a newspaper fears doing something that might be controversial because they don't know who is going to come out of the woodwork to sue them, I think that certainly has a chilling effect," he said.</p><p>Of course, this chilling effect is exactly what the First Amendment is supposed to guard against.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK7IpaOip56WtrOxjKecsKtfpbK1sdFmq6GhlaF6p8HNnapmoKWhuG60zqCYp2Wjqra1ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-lim-min-su-from-singles-inferno-season-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Lim Min-su From Singles Inferno Season 2?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-the-meaning-of-bahay-kubo-song-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is the meaning of bahay kubo song?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20021101993030.html>BECKS FURTHER EXTENDS HIS PROMOTIONAL PORTFOLIO</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./horror-filmmaker-roth-html.html>Horror filmmaker Roth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-weekend-deals-03-29-2024-8622474.html>Nordstrom Rack, Tory Burch, Gap, and Amazon</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-hired-times-square-desnudas-humiliate-chef-bobby-flay-controversial-restaurant-owner-rumored-unfaithful-ex-wife-january-jones-visted-topless-ladies-painted-word-cheater-html.html>Bobby Flay is visited by Time Square desnudas painted with the word 'cheater'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jackie-speier-net-worth-2020-2021.html>Jackie Speier Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVibe.
