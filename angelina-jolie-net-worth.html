She has been one of the highest-paid actresses globally at times, earning up to $20 million for a single job.</p><p>As of this writing, Angelina Jolie’s net worth is $120 million. Angelina gets between $20 and $30 million per year from film earnings and endorsements in a regular year. For instance, Angelina made $35 million between June 2019 and June 2020.</p><h2>Angelina Jolie Money Problems</h2><p>Angelina claimed to be cash-strapped and wanted further financial help from Brad Pitt in August 2018 as part of their nasty divorce fight. According to court filings, Pitt gave Jolie $8 million as a down payment for the $25 million Cecil B.</p><p>Demille’s estate because she lacked the finances. Angelina is likely to have substantial cash stashed away in trusts and investments.</p><p>When Pitt and Jolie married in 2014, they decided that they would not require a prenup because both were entering the marriage with “over $100 million.”</p><p>So, where has Angelina Jolie’s money gone? One explanation is that she did not want to sacrifice her assets to purchase a new property knowing that Pitt would probably supply the finances.</p><p>Additionally, between August 2017 and August 2018, Angelina earned $28 million in salary and endorsements, making her the world’s second-highest-paid actress.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Angelina-Jolie-Net-Worth.jpg><h2>Angelina Jolie Childhood</h2><p>Angelina Jolie Voight was born in Los Angeles, California, on June 4, 1975.

Rather than a traditional wedding gown, Jolie donned black rubber trousers and a white t-shirt on which she had inscribed her groom’s name in blood. They divorced the next year.</p><p>After dating for two months, Jolie’s divorce was finalized just before she married actor Billy Bob Thornton in Las Vegas on May 5, 2000. They met on the set of Pushing Tin in 1999.</p><p>The pair were well-known for their public displays of affection, including wearing vials of one another’s blood around their necks.</p><p>In March 2002, Jolie and Thornton adopted a son, Maddox, from Cambodia. They unexpectedly parted ways three months later. On May 27, 2003, their divorce was completed.</p><p>Jolie was accused of orchestrating Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston’s October 2005 divorce.

Jolie and Pitt dated for twelve years. Six children were born into their family, three of them were adopted.

Demille lived on the 2-acre estate from 1913 to 1959.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpa2dgaHx0fI6apaCdnJ67onnJqKOinV2jsrV51qipraBf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sadie-sandler-net-worth-income-salary-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sadie Sandler Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./266765-t-boz-is-proud-her-beautiful-baby-chase-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>T-Boz Is Proud of 'Her Beautiful Baby' Chase as She Shares New Photo of Her with Hair Bun</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20021101993030.html>BECKS FURTHER EXTENDS HIS PROMOTIONAL PORTFOLIO</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./horror-filmmaker-roth-html.html>Horror filmmaker Roth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-weekend-deals-03-29-2024-8622474.html>Nordstrom Rack, Tory Burch, Gap, and Amazon</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-hired-times-square-desnudas-humiliate-chef-bobby-flay-controversial-restaurant-owner-rumored-unfaithful-ex-wife-january-jones-visted-topless-ladies-painted-word-cheater-html.html>Bobby Flay is visited by Time Square desnudas painted with the word 'cheater'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jackie-speier-net-worth-2020-2021.html>Jackie Speier Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVibe.
