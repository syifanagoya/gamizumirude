She wasn’t going to get better.”</p><p>Ephron spent her final days at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, surrounded by friends and family.</p><p>She is survived by her third husband, writer Nicholas Pileggi, and two sons from a previous marriage to journalist Carl Bernstein.</p><p>Mayor Bloomberg was among those payng tribute. “Nora always loved a good New York story, and she could tell them like no one else,” he said.</p><p>Celebrities flooded Twitter.</p><p>“RIP Nora Ephron,” wrote fellow director Ron Howard. “Brilliant, gracious and funny!”</p><p>“A witty, charming, lovely person,” wrote comic Albert Brooks.</p><p>“A great and prolific writer,” tweeted actress Sarah Silverman. “A warm and kind soul.”</p><p>A memorial luncheon is being planned by Ephron’s closest friends, including Barbara Walters.</p><p>Ephron was born in Manhattan, moved to Beverly Hills at 4, and returned in the 1960s. She won her job at The Post by writing a parody of the paper that impressed publisher Dorothy Schiff, and stayed on for five years.</p><p>She got her first taste of Hollywood when she helped Bernstein pen a screenplay draft for “All the President’s Men.”</p><p>It was based on the book he and Bob Woodward about the Watergate scandal they had covered for The Washington Post.</p><p>Her draft was scrapped, but her talent was noticed.</p><p>It was the drama “Silkwood,” starring Meryl Streep, in 1984 that cemented her celluloid success with an Oscar nomination.</p><p>Two years later, her semiautobiographical novel about her rocky marriage to Bernstein was made into the film “Heartburn,” starring Streep and Jack Nicholson.</p><p>Her film hits kept rolling in, with the Oscar-nominated “When Harry Met Sally” in 1989, starring Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan.</p><p>Ryan would go on to be somewhat of a muse for Ephron, playing her lonely-heart women.</p><p>Ephron won an Oscar for 1993’s “Sleepless in Seattle,” starring Ryan and Tom Hanks — a film that pointedly ended happily ever after atop the Empire State Building. She wrote and directed the film.</p><p>The movie was such a hit that Ryan and Hanks were recast in Ephron’s 1998 Manhattan-set “You’ve Got Mail,” which she also wrote and directed.</p><p>Her play “Love, Loss and What I Wore” — written with sister and frequent collaborator Delia Ephron — has been performing off-Broadway for the past three years. Her final film, “Julie & Julia,” was released in 2009.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2JlfnN7j29ma29fqLmmsc%2BlnKyrXZ67br%2FEmqutpJVixLO1056pZqafp65usc%2BhqaimXZmyorCMmqtmb2Fk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-ceo-of-gamestop-is-cashing-out.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The CEO Of GameStop Is Stepping Down And Cashing Out</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-robert-akerlof-married-wife-and-family-details-on-janet-yellen-son.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Robert Akerlof Married?
