household name</a> while defending Johnny Depp in his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">blockbuster defamation trial against ex-wife Amber Heard</a> — has signed on to represent “Yellowstone” actress Q’orianka Kilcher in a new fraud case.</p><p>Vasquez, 38, confirmed the news on Wednesday, saying she was “determined to defend” Kilcher, 32, who — ironically — plays attorney Angela Blue Thunder on the hit <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Paramount</a> streaming series.</p><p>The actress was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">charged with two felony counts of workers compensation fraud by the California Department of Insurance</a> for receiving nearly $100,000 in disability benefits that were allegedly “undeserved.”</p><p>Kilcher sustained a neck and shoulder injury on the set of the film “Dora and the Lost City of Gold” that she claimed left her unable to work for a year.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image

McLeod/Paramount/Kobal/Shutt</span></figure><p>According to the DOI, the star was treated by a doctor several times in late 2018, but subsequently stopped treatment and “did not respond to the insurance company handling her claim on behalf of her employer.”&nbsp;</p><p>Then, in October 2019, the actress allegedly contacted her insurance company claiming she had been unable to take on work since the accident “because her neck pain was too severe.”&nbsp;A doctor treating Kilcher allegedly signed off on the claim.</p><p>Based on those statements, she began receiving “temporary total disability benefits” a short time later.</p><p>However, review of her wage information determined that Kilcher had actually worked on “Yellowstone” from July to October 2019, according to DOI officials.</p><p>The organization says Kilcher received a total of $96,838 in “undeserved” disability from October 2019 through September 2021.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image

to authorities and pleaded not guilty at her arraignment on May 27.</p><p>Vasquez — who was promoted to partner at the law firm Brown Rudnick LLP after Depp’s legal victory — will take on the case alongside attorney Steve Cook.</p><p>In a statement given to<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Fox News, </a>the pair said: “We are determined to defend Ms. Kilcher in this important case which examines the inherent flaws in the disability compensation system. Ms. Kilcher is a well-respected and pioneering actress in Hollywood, and we intend to clear her name.”</p><p>Kilcher was last seen in the Season 3 finale of “Yellowstone” back in 2020, with her character mysteriously absent from the fourth season, which aired earlier this year.</p><p>However, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">some media reports,</a> the starlet will return to screens in the fifth season of the mega-hit, which is set to premiere Nov. 13.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Vasquez congratulates Depp after the defamation trial verdict fell in his favor. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3N7j3JmaW9fmbKxvIylmLCxlad6pK3MoqOlnV2rrrS91J6xZqyfYrGmssSnm2axlaG5sMPSraannV2owaK%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-vanessa-posso-all-about-gervonta-davis-girlfriend-as-toothbrush-incident-sparks-wild-reactions-online.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Vanessa Posso?
