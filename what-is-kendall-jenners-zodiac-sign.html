She walked the runways since 2014 for Marc Jacobs and has since modeled for notable luxury brands like Chanel, Givenchy, and Victoria Secret. With her <a href=#>mile-high legs and bone structure</a>, she’s truly a “<a href=# rel=noopener>Runway Goddess</a>.” Now fans ask, has her success been written on the stars?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Kendall Jenner was born on November 3, 1995, which makes her a Scorpio.&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebanswers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/shutterstock_1131134291.jpg><p>Scroll to learn more about the model-businesswoman’s traits based on her astrological placements.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kendall Jenner as a Scorpio</h2><p>An “intense, secretive, mysterious powerhouse,” Kendall shows off her fierceness by going against the family “business” by pursuing a modeling career. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Astrotheme</a>, her dominant element is Fire, which endows her with intuition, energy, courage, self-confidence, and enthusiasm. All good traits that propelled her to gain massive success in fashion.</p><p>Scorpios are known to be <a href=# rel=noopener>super dark and secretive</a> and we see that so evident in Kendall Jenner. While people find her whole brood on every screen all over the planet, Kendall prefers to keep&nbsp;everything hush hush and establish her domination of the fashion world all by herself.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Walking the runways and appearing in ad campaigns is her public life. But in true Scorpio fashion, Kendall is very much protective of her <a href=# rel=noopener>privacy</a>, especially with her personal and <a href=# rel=noopener>love life</a>. The old adage “still water runs deep” very much resembles Kendall’s personality.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Family Background</h2><p>There’s nothing more about the <a href=#>Kardashian-Jenner</a> clan that we don’t know, right? But here are some interesting facts about Kendall (and her famous family).&nbsp;</p><p>She was born Kendall Nicole Jenner, the first daughter of <a href=#>Bruce (aka Caitlyn) and Kris Jenner</a> in Calabasas, California. Both her parents are Scorpios and we can see where Kendall got her drive to succeed.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Happy birthday to my beautiful <a href=# rel=noopener>@kendalljenner</a>!! You stole my heart from the very moment you were born! You are such an incredibly special girl and I thank God every single day that He blessed me with being your mommy. You have brought all of us so much joy and sunshine!!!! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/k9rT4ZQhHm</a></p>— Kris Jenner (@KrisJenner) <a href=# rel=noopener>November 3, 2022</a></figure><p>Kendall has a total of 8 step siblings, 4 from her dad’s side–three older brothers (<a href=# rel=noopener>Burt</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Brandon</a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener>Brody Jenner</a>) and an older sister (Casey Marino), and four older sisters from her mom’s previous marriage (<a href=#>Kourtney</a>, <a href=#>Kim</a>, <a href=#>Khloé</a>) and an older brother, <a href=# rel=noopener>Rob Kashardian</a>. <a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a> is Kendall’s only full sibling.&nbsp;</p><p>She used to be a cheerleader for her school football team in <a href=#>Sierra Leone High School</a>. But as her modeling career progressed, the family decided that Kendall be <a href=# rel=noopener>homeschooled</a> instead, <a href=#>along with her sister Kylie</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>With this decision came the hard part for any teenage girl: Kendall had to unfollow all her school friends so she won’t see them posting pictures online about their school life and attending the prom.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Career and Breakthrough</h2><p>Heartbreaking indeed! But the fierce Scorpio wanted to achieve more at a young age. Kendall’s modeling career started when she was 14 years old, while signed under <a href=# rel=noopener>Wilhelmina Models</a>. Kendall Jenner’s first modeling job was for <a href=# rel=noopener>Forever 21</a>, and then appeared on the cover of <a href=# rel=noopener>Teen Vogue</a> the following year.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Young Kendall was on fire and she went on to the big leagues under a new agency, Society Management. She became the “It Girl” for high fashion and became a brand ambassador of the cosmetics brand, Estee Lauder. She later appeared in editorials of style bibles such as <a href=# rel=noopener>Harper Bazaar</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Vogue</a> and<a href=# rel=noopener> Vanity Fair</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Net Worth</h2><p>No wonder Forbes listed her as the <a href=# rel=noopener>highest-paid supermodel of 2018</a>, dethroning veteran model <a href=# rel=noopener>Gisele Bündchen</a>, who ruled since 2002. Kendall debuted at number 16 on the Forbes list in 2015 with an estimated annual income of $4 million.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Currently, Kendall Jenner’s net worth is estimated at $45 million according to authorities <a href=# rel=noopener>Wealthy Gorilla</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Celebrity Net Worth</a>. Aside from her earnings as a model, Kendall makes her money from sponsored posts on Instagram and from her tequila brand, <a href=# rel=noopener>818 Tequila</a> (launched in 2021).</p><p>Kendall Jenner has bought and sold homes since 2014, when she was around 19 years old. She also owns a pretty impressive <a href=#>car collection</a>, which includes classic muscle cars as well as modern luxury ones.
