and Instagram filters: the glamorous new breed of bikie girlfriends are working their toned and tanned butts off in a social media war as fierce as gang rivalry.</p><p>Unlike their comparatively daggy counterparts of the old bikie era, the new girlfriends of Australia’s outlaw motorcycle gang (OMCG) members are polished and well-groomed.</p><p>The images of the women, enhanced by filters or cosmetic procedures and posted on Instagram and other social media accounts rival those of aspiring models.</p><p>Even if some of the women are too heavily tattooed for traditional catwalks, they are spruiking beauty products and snapping up hundreds of followers to their accounts.</p><p>The queens of the latest fad are Gold Coast sisters Rikki Louise and Allaina Jones, the girlfriends of ex-Bandido chapter president Brett “Kaos” Pechey and Ben “Notorious” Geppert.</p><p>Among their number are the equally glamorous Chireez Beytell, the former girlfriend of Comanchero associate Liam Scorsese.</p><p>Last week, <a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=587bdccbb31fb11f2165df40ba0094a3 data-tgev-label=national data-tgev-metric=ev>Scorsese was shot dead by Queensland police</a> after he was found wielding a knife while trying to break into a house.</p><p>A friend posted on Facebook “Forever his queen” with a purple heart beside an attractive filtered photo of Ms Beytell with the bikie on her page last Sunday.</p><p>Ms Beytell follows on social media other girlfriends or wives who have also seen their slain bikies go to an early grave, including the ex girlfriend of Rebel Micky “Notorious” Davey, <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=5bacf4a0b8941c801cd6150b86492718 data-tgev-label=national data-tgev-metric=ev>gunned down in his driveway </a>in 2016.</p><p>They include Carolina Gonzalez, the wife of<a

ex-Comanchero national president Mick Hawi who </a>was shot in the face two weeks ago at a Sydney gym and died in hospital.</p><p>Another glamorous bikie wife, although a more natural beauty, is the partner of senior Rebel, Chris Rymer.</p><p>The couple who posted photos of themselves and luxury shopping expeditions, celebrated on Instagram their forthcoming baby news following Rymer’s release from prison.</p><p>Ms Jones, who now calls herself Allaina Vader, has seen bikie rivalry erupt into violence before.</p><p>Five years ago she was the girlfriend of Australia’s most feared bikies, Bandidos enforcer turned Hells Angel, John Fahey.</p><p>With her dyed red hair, multiple tattoos and shredded black pants and thongs, the pretty-faced Allaina looked more Harley Davidson convention chick or grid girl.</p><p>In 2018, she and her equally attractive sister Rikki Louise have transformed themselves into Instagram stars with model looks.</p><p>Riki Louise has been promoting on Instagram the product she credits with giving her such a dazzling smile, Billionaire Teeth Whitening.</p><p>The women, both in their 20s, are two of three Gold Coast sisters who attended Miami State High School.</p><p>Allaina, who has a daughter with John Fahey, moved on to new boyfriend, Notorious Geppert last year.</p><p>The loved up couple who each sport almost as many tattoos as one another, post frequent photos of themselves together on Instagram.</p><p>Allaina, who has her own cometic and make-up business, and Geppert, were recently <a class=body-link href=# data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=80e779dc663fa0005e9e0b5a8fcca78c data-tgev-label=technology data-tgev-metric=ev>marched off </a>the exclusive Hamilton Island resort while celebrating his 26th birthday.</p><p>Whitsunday Island Local Area Command issued Geppert, 26, and Ms Vader, 27, with infringement notices for threatening behaviour in or near a licensed premises.</p><p>Later Ms Vader dismissed the penalty, which incurs a fine of up to $683, with an Instagram post which also disparaged the island.</p><p>“Two fines pfffff brrrrrrt throw it on our tabs ya dogs,” Ms Vader posted.</p><p>“I hated it there! Everything was shut the humans f***ed got our money back and free yacht ride to the mainland F***ing winning.”</p><p>The couple had earlier posted photographs lazing around the Whitsunday Islands Apartments pool displaying their many tattoos.</p><p>Rikki Louise Jones began going out with the heavily tattooed Kaos Pechey in 2017.</p><p>The two couples shared photographs of themselves relaxing as a group in the sun on the Gold Coast, with the two men baring their multiple tattoos in the surf.</p><p>But last month, that friendship seemed to be over between the two men.</p><p>Last week <a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=e5515cc371a30df3cd77e73316fd1bdc data-tgev-label=technology data-tgev-metric=ev>Geppert took aim at Pechey</a>, who was once Queensland’s most wanted bikie when he was extradited from Thailand to face extortion charges in 2015.</p><p>“Notorious” made the unsubstantiated claim that Kaos was a “dog”, or police informant, before disrespectfully dumping his Brothers 4 Life gang T-shirt onto the ground.</p><p>Previously Geppert had proudly posed in the shirt for an Instagram shot with the caption “gangbanger”.</p><p>It is unclear whether the public falling-out between Geppert and Pechey will affect the strong bond between their girlfriends.</p><p>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb6%2FOpmWarV%2BpsqS0zaijqJ%2BpZLyvuMinnGirn5i2oriOrZitrJ%2BkwG7A0aisrWWgpMK1v4yapZ1lmaPAta3Gq5imZZaeubWx0axkm6GbnrJuvNGipZydo6iytHnOn2Ssp5Oerq15zJ6boplfo7K4v4ysq6iqqWSGpa2QapucmWCbsXF9k2yacJmUloOjspNwmZ9qk2eEpw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jeffrey-epstein-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-103821-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jeffrey Epstein Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-owns-bucees.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Owns Buc-ee's?
