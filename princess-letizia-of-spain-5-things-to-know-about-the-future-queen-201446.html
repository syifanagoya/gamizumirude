Naturally, the attention went to Felipe’s stunning wife <strong>Princess Letizia</strong>, who is poised to soon become the Queen of Spain. Here are 5 things to know about the future monarch.</p><p><strong>1. She’s a Career Woman</strong></p><p>Letizia, 41, is a former television news anchor who comes from a line of Spanish commoners: Her father was also a journalist, her mom was a nurse, and her grandfather, a taxi driver. Letizia’s father Jesus Ortiz once described his eldest daughter as a “perfectionist,” who has “her head well screwed on.”</p><p>Though she eventually gave up her career to focus on royal duties, the princess once reported from some of the most hostile environments in the world, including Iraq. The beauty started her career in Mexico, where she worked at a newspaper, before jumping to broadcast TV. Letizia worked for Bloomberg TV’s Spanish division, CNN plus, and finally, Televisión Española (TVE), Spain’s highest-rated news network, where she was the weekday news anchor. In 2000, Letizia was named by her colleagues as Spain’s most accomplished journalist under 30.</p><p><strong>2. Prince Felipe Is Her Second Husband</strong></p><p>In her mid-20s, Letizia married her boyfriend of 10 years,<strong> Alonso Guerrero Pérez </strong>— only to split months later.</p><p>In November 2002, she met Prince Felipe, now 46, while covering an oil spill in northern Spain. He proposed the following year, and Letizia announced she would leave TVE during their official engagement presentation. The two wed in 2004, attracting more than 25 million viewers on TV. Letizia wore a classy silk gown by Spanish designer <strong>Manuel Pertegaz</strong>, which featured a whopping 15-foot train.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><strong>3. She’s Just Like Us — Sort Of</strong></p><p>Not only does Letizia have a mortgage on her own apartment in a Madrid suburb, but she also takes the subway, cheers for her respective sports teams, and is a hands-on mom. The future Queen takes her daughters, Infantas<strong> Leonor</strong>, 8, and <strong>Sofia</strong>, 7, to and from school. She’s also known — to the delight of royal subjects — for dressing her girls in pretty designer duds!</p><p>Letizia, a fashionista in her own right, is an avid supporter of Spanish retailers and designers, promoting brands like Mango and Zara. She’s also worn numerous gowns by<strong> Felipe Varela</strong> to public engagements to help call attention to local talent.</p><p>Unlike <strong>Us</strong>, the princess bears six official titles.They include Princess of Asturias, Princess of Viana, Princess of Girona, Duchess of Montblanc, Countess of Cervera, and Lady of Balaguer.</p><p><strong>4. She’s Had Plastic Surgery</strong></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>But it’s not what you think! The princess underwent nose surgery in August 2008 due to a “breathing problem.” The palace said that the procedure straightened her nasal cartilage.</p><p><strong>5. She’s Experienced Tragedy</strong></p><p>Letizia, the oldest of three girls, lost one of her sisters in February 2007. At the age of 31, her sibling<strong> Erika</strong> committed suicide during the princess’ second pregnancy. The royal held on to her husband’s arm and broke down into tears after Erika’s memorial mass. “Thanks to all who have felt sadness over the death of my little sister,” she said to reporters during the emotional moment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKeroZ6YsrS%2FjKWcraGqnq5uu8VmqqmZmaN6dnnToaCnn6NiwbB5yqemsGWRl7y2wIytn55llqrBtr7EZqiunZWjenN8kG1rbw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./deelishis-net-worth-2020-2021.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Deelishis Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Dating, Kids, Bio-Wiki</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./going-live-host-sarah-greene-presents-this-morning.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Going Live! host Sarah Greene steps into Holly Willoughby's shoes to present This Morning</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20021101993030.html>BECKS FURTHER EXTENDS HIS PROMOTIONAL PORTFOLIO</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./horror-filmmaker-roth-html.html>Horror filmmaker Roth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-weekend-deals-03-29-2024-8622474.html>Nordstrom Rack, Tory Burch, Gap, and Amazon</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-hired-times-square-desnudas-humiliate-chef-bobby-flay-controversial-restaurant-owner-rumored-unfaithful-ex-wife-january-jones-visted-topless-ladies-painted-word-cheater-html.html>Bobby Flay is visited by Time Square desnudas painted with the word 'cheater'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jackie-speier-net-worth-2020-2021.html>Jackie Speier Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVibe.
