Police officers and hazmat teams were at the site quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>Firefighters had a tough time entering the house because of a gas leak. Southwest Gas, a nearby utility, cut off service to the residents, and residents were instructed to leave their homes. Before a police investigation in the early afternoon could begin, a hazmat crew spent several hours looking into the house.</p><p>Phoenix Police Sgt Melissa Soliz informed the media during a press conference that two adults and three children had died "with apparent evidence of trauma." The victims' identities were kept a secret. A homicide inquiry has been launched by police. However, Soliz stated, "We do not believe that there is a suspect on the loose right now." In a statement to local media, Southwest Gas claimed that no leaks had been discovered in the region and added, "Our hearts are heavy with today's news and we are grateful for the quick response of first responders."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoal2Ytaq4w6ucp2WRoryvs4xuZJ%2BnpaOxbrDEmptmmqWbs6K4zmaeq6emmnqpu8yeZLCdnKG7pr%2FSZpqhnZOgeq7B0Z2cq2WjqraktcOe</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./candyman-2021.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Candyman | Rotten Tomatoes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-zenyara-estate-is-gearing-up-for-coachella-2022.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Zenyara Estate Is Gearing Up for Coachella 2022</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20021101993030.html>BECKS FURTHER EXTENDS HIS PROMOTIONAL PORTFOLIO</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./horror-filmmaker-roth-html.html>Horror filmmaker Roth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-weekend-deals-03-29-2024-8622474.html>Nordstrom Rack, Tory Burch, Gap, and Amazon</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-hired-times-square-desnudas-humiliate-chef-bobby-flay-controversial-restaurant-owner-rumored-unfaithful-ex-wife-january-jones-visted-topless-ladies-painted-word-cheater-html.html>Bobby Flay is visited by Time Square desnudas painted with the word 'cheater'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jackie-speier-net-worth-2020-2021.html>Jackie Speier Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVibe.
