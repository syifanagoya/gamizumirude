Ratajkowski, who was born with the desire to become an actor, quickly followed her dream.</p><p>After a few roles as a child artist, she transitioned to modeling during her adolescence and has been a sought-after face ever since. Ratajkowski’s openness to everything, including nudity, set her apart from other models.</p><p>Her uninhibited attitude stems from her frequent visits to Europe’s nude beaches as a child, which had a profound impact on her young mind.</p><p>Her appearance on the cover of an erotic magazine, in 2012, was instrumental in her bagging a role in the record-breaking music video, ‘Blurred Lines’.</p><p>Interestingly, Ratajkowski had previously rejected the offer and only agreed to do it after much persuasion.
