Although their <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.j-14.com/posts/meg-donnelly-love-life-boyfriend-single-past-relationships/>relationship</a> timeline is unknown, the actress reportedly confirmed their romance during an Instagram Live. She also paid tribute to Zulfikar on his birthday for the past three years.</p><p class=dh>In 2020, she shared a snap of sitting beside Zulfikar with both legs across his thigh while leaning towards him. "You are the brightest light," she said. "Thank you for showing me what love truly is."</p><p class=dh>Two years later, she posted a series of photos and videos of her boyfriend being affectionate, silly, and sweet.
