The former couple asked each other extremely personal questions and had to either answer truthfully or eat a disgusting food item chosen by the other person.</p><p>For her first question, Jenner asked Styles, “Which songs on <a href=#>your last album</a> were about me?” and said she was “dying to know” the answer. Almost immediately, the former One Direction member covered his face with his hands. He then reached over for a napkin, tucked it into his shirt and grabbed a fork and knife, preparing to eat the cod sperm that the model selected for him.</p><p>After Jenner shouted, “Ew!” Styles almost reconsidered his decision. “So, I’d say track, um …” he began before hesitantly yet bravely diving into the Japanese delicacy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Harry-Styles-Eats-Cod-Sperm-to-Avoid-Telling-Ex-Kendall-Jenner-Which-Songs-He-Wrote-About-Her-inline.jpg><p>“Just swallow it!” the reality star urged the X Factor U.K. alum as he slowly chewed the cod sperm. “Stop!”</p><p>Styles then turned to the audience and asked, “To spit or to swallow, that is the question.” Ultimately, he spit it out and took a giant gulp of water.</p><p>“It really carries an aftertaste,” he said, slightly gagging.</p><p>Later in the game, the Dunkirk actor asked Jenner to name the “most unlikeable supermodel”; she had someone in mind but sipped a salmon smoothie instead. She then inquired whether he has ever watched an episode of her family’s E! reality show; he has, “the one where you’re eating salads in the kitchen and then you all were shouting at each other.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Harry-Styles-Eats-Cod-Sperm-to-Avoid-Telling-Ex-Kendall-Jenner-Which-Songs-He-Wrote-About-Her.jpg><p>The pair were briefly linked in late 2013. They sparked rumors that they had reconciled their romance in December 2015 after being <a href=#>spotted on vacation in Anguilla</a>. Then, in September 2016, they <a href=#>spent three consecutive days together</a>. However, a source close to Styles told Us Weekly at the time that the duo were just “friends” and <a href=#>“didn’t stop being friends”</a> after their relationship ended.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Styles — whose new album, <a href=#>Fine Line</a>, is out Friday, December 13 — most recently dated model <a href=#><strong>Camille Rowe</strong></a>, while Jenner’s <a href=#>split from NBA player <strong>Ben Simmons</strong></a> made headlines in May.</p><p>The Late Late Show With James Corden airs on CBS weeknights at 12:35 a.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKeppSWua15yZ6lp52iYq60t9Jmn5qqoq56tMDYpZysZaedtqS0jKymp5%2BjYrWmedarpq2dXZavsMHTZp%2Beql8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./virgin-river-alexandra-breckenridge-throwback-photo-early-career.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Virgin River's Alexandra Breckenridge shares incredible throwback to early career - and her hair was</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jujutsu-kaisen-season-2-episode-18.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 Episode 18 Release Date, Countdown, Time, Spoilers, Where to Watch, Recap &amp;amp;</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./20021101993030.html>BECKS FURTHER EXTENDS HIS PROMOTIONAL PORTFOLIO</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./horror-filmmaker-roth-html.html>Horror filmmaker Roth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./best-weekend-deals-03-29-2024-8622474.html>Nordstrom Rack, Tory Burch, Gap, and Amazon</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-hired-times-square-desnudas-humiliate-chef-bobby-flay-controversial-restaurant-owner-rumored-unfaithful-ex-wife-january-jones-visted-topless-ladies-painted-word-cheater-html.html>Bobby Flay is visited by Time Square desnudas painted with the word 'cheater'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jackie-speier-net-worth-2020-2021.html>Jackie Speier Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 EchoVibe.
